#Multivariate Testing [WiP]

You've decided to start or improve a website or app, so presumably you've read up on [user experience](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/27/pragmatic-ux-techniques-for-smarter-websites/) and have a ton of ideas.    

But which design **will work best for your audience**?    
Which piece of [micro-copy](https://econsultancy.com/blog/64951-six-brilliant-bits-of-micro-copy-you-can-implement-today/) will get people to share things with their friends?    
If you [make your form shorter](http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/08/11/form-conversion-facts/) will more people sign up to your service?

##Why learn this? 
>By changing different things _in a controlled environment_ and **_measuring the outcome_** of these changes, you **know \*exactly\* which changes achieve your site's goals** (increase your [conversion rate](#terminology)) and by how much.

Now you know where to focus your efforts! Multivariate testing allows you to **get your message across** to the people already coming to your site or app **in the best way possible**.

##What is it?
People decide whether to leave or engage with a site [in the first 8 seconds](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/what-converting-websites-do/) - that's not much time to capture people's attention so you've got to get it right _for your audience_.

>Multivariate testing (MVT) aims to test a number of things on a site to understand **which combination of things best achieves the site's purpose** (whether that is increasing sign ups, sales or people clicking on articles for example).

A few of the more obvious things to test include:
* A [call to action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_%28marketing%29) (including wording and placing)
* Titles and [copy](http://untamedwriting.com/the-difference-between-web-copy-and-web-content-and-why-your-site-needs-both/)
* Placement & colour of elements
* Form fields a layout

**_NB. MVT can also be used to taste anything from email layouts to sales ads. For simplicity, in this introduction we'll stick with websites._**

##Multivariate vs A/B Testing

In [**A/B testing**](http://www.widerfunnel.com/solutions/website-testing/ab-split-testing) you test 2 (or more) different versions of your website by splitting the traffic evenly between them and seeing which one performs better. You can either test 2 completely different designs of your site _or_ you can pick just **one element** you want to change and keep all other things equal.

In **multivariate testing** you pick a certain number of elements on a page and **simultaneously test multiple combinations of them** to understand which provides the best results. You could see it as running many A/B tests at once.

In the illustration below, I've used testing 2 different headlines, 2 different colour buttons and having a video on the homepage as an example.    
Just these 3 elements mean testing _8 different versions of your site at once_.

|       | A/B testing   | Multivariate testing |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----: |
| **What can you test?**     | Different layouts & designs or changes to single elements | Effects of changes to combinations of elements |
| **Number of visitors required for meaningful results**    | Relatively low      |   High |
| **Time required for meaningful results** | Short      |    Considerably longer |
| **Best used for**  | Significantly different layouts & designs or low traffic sites | Tweaking and optimising combinations of elements |

#Terminology
A quick list of terms you may see 
* **Conversion rate** is the percentage of people who come to your site who _do what you want them to do_ such as sign up to your service, buy your product or share your content
* **Element contribution** allows you to determine the percentage that each element contributes to your site's goal
* A/B testing
* Split testing
* Conversion optimization
